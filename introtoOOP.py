                                         # OOP in Python
# OOP is a programming in which we uses objects and classes to structure code.
# It allows for better organization, reusability, and maintainability of code.

 
    
# üåü What is OOP?
# OOP = Object Oriented Programming
# It's a style of coding where you organize your code into blueprints (classes) and real things (objects).
# Helps make big code clean and easy to manage.  
# Also used to create our own methods . 

            

# üß± What is a Class?
# A class is like a blueprint for creating objects./User defined data types.

# üßç What is an Object?
# An object is a real thing made using the class.

# üß† Tip to Remember:
# Class = Blueprint/template
# Object = Real thing built from blueprint
# If Student is the plan, then s1 and s2 are actual students

# a=person()
